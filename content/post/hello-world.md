I've switched blogs <a href="http://polybuildr.github.io/old-blog/bit-nebula-and-petroglyph/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">far too many times</a> by now. But an interesting pattern is that each blog seems to correspond with a new phase of my life. I had my first (sort of active) blog when I was in school, then another (rather inactive) blog in college, and now that I'm just out of college, I guess it's time for another (hopefully active) blog.

So, hi! I'm Vivek Ghaisas, and I hope to be writing a lot more stuff here in the coming time.
